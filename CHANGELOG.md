## [Unreleased] — PR #194 single-rollup (security floor + connector polymorphism + test parity)

This rollup closes the audit gaps identified in the v3 connector
review and lands PR #141's matrix in a single coherent set of
changes. Ordering: Phase A (P1 mechanical) → Phase B (S0 security
floor) → Phase C (S1/S2/S7 + matrix-TODO cleanup) → Phase E (test
parity for ZeptoClaw + Claude Code + Codex) → Phase D (test sweep +
docs).

### Security

- **S0.8** Inspect hook scan timeout tightened from 5s to 200ms; per-IP
  rate limiter (20 rps, 40 burst) applied to `/api/v1/inspect/*` so a
  malicious or runaway hook caller cannot DoS the gateway. Loopback
  callers stay exempt so dev iteration is unaffected.
- **S0.13** CSRF middleware no longer exempts `OPTIONS` from
  `Sec-Fetch-Site` checks. Cross-origin preflights are now rejected by
  default.
- **S0.12** `Connector.ProviderProbe` interface added; the gateway
  refuses to start with zero usable upstreams unless
  `cfg.Guardrail.AllowEmptyProviders` is set explicitly. ZeptoClaw,
  Codex, ClaudeCode, OpenClaw all implement the probe.
- **S0.3** ZeptoClaw `Authenticate` no longer trusts loopback
  unconditionally. Local processes must present a valid `X-DC-Auth`
  bearer once a gateway token has been provisioned. `Route` now gates
  `RawAPIKey` capture behind `isChatPath`; non-chat traffic gets
  passthrough mode and an empty key.
- **S0.2** First-boot `DEFENSECLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` synthesis. The
  gateway and sidecar generate a 32-byte CSPRNG hex token at startup
  (atomic `0o600` write to `~/.defenseclaw/.env`) and persist it across
  reboots. The empty-token loopback allow path was removed; an empty
  token now fails closed. `TestTokenAuth_DisabledWhenEmpty` was
  inverted and renamed `TestTokenAuth_FailsClosedWhenEmpty`.
- **S0.5** `defenseclaw setup rotate-token` CLI subcommand. Generates a
  new gateway token, rewrites `~/.defenseclaw/.env`, refreshes hook
  `.token` files, and prompts the operator to restart the agent.
- **S0.4** Hook scripts (`hooks/*.sh`) source a new
  `hooks/_hardening.sh` that pins `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`, an
  ephemeral `HOME`, `ulimit -t 5 -v 524288 -n 32`, and an allow-list
  regex for payload-derived paths.
- **S0.10** Telemetry payloads carry an HMAC-SHA-256 derived from the
  device key via HKDF (`info="defenseclaw-telemetry-v1"`). The
  `redaction.AssertNoCredentials` guard panics in dev / no-ops in
  prod when a known key prefix appears in egress payloads — defense
  in depth against a future refactor accidentally adding an
  `APIKey` field.
- **S0.1 (descoped)** ed25519 plugin manifest signing is deferred. The
  existing sha256-pin + symlink containment + perm check remain the
  baseline, augmented by an owner-UID check and an audit-pipeline
  `EventPluginLoadRejected` event. ed25519 signing tracked as a
  follow-up.

### Connectors

- **C1 (S2.4)** Hard-coded per-connector `case` switches replaced by a
  generic `registerHookHandler` registration table. The gateway now
  iterates `HookEndpoint`-implementing connectors via
  `registerConnectorHookRoutes` instead of name-keyed dispatch in
  `api.go`. Adding a new connector is a single `registerHookHandler`
  call plus a `HookEndpoint` implementation. The follow-up move of
  the handler bodies (`claude_code_hook.go`, `codex_hook.go`) into the
  `connector/` package is deliberately split into a second commit per
  the plan's own commit-splitting guidance — the registration seam in
  `hook_register.go` already lets the relocation happen without
  touching call sites.
- **C2 (S2.5)** `HookScriptOwner` interface drives hook-script
  generation. `WriteHookScriptsForConnectorObject` is the new
  interface-driven entry point; the legacy package-level
  `connectorHookScripts` map remains as a backward-compatible shim and
  delegates through the connector registry.
- **C3** ZeptoClaw `before_tool` and Codex hook invocation are
  documented as **WONTFIX (architectural)** in
  `docs/CONNECTOR-MATRIX.md`. Both are limitations of the host agents
  (no settings-based external-script hook support); the proxy-side
  Route() path provides the actual security guarantee.
- **C4 (S1.3)** New `sidecar_watcher_matrix_test.go` exercises
  `resolveWatcherDirs` for all four connectors. The watcher correctly
  picks `~/.<connector>/skills` and `~/.<connector>/plugins` based on
  the active connector configuration.
- **C5 (S7.6)** New Python `cli/tests/test_install_smoke.py` runs
  `setup → disable → uninstall` round-trip across all four connectors
  with isolated `$HOME` contexts.
- **C6** `defenseclaw plugin list` now enumerates host-owned plugins
  for non-OpenClaw connectors. Each connector's plugin directories are
  scanned for manifest files (`plugin.json` / `package.json` /
  `plugin.yaml`); merged output labels each entry with `source:
  "defenseclaw"` or `source: "host"`.
- **C7** AIBOM (`defenseclaw aibom`) gains per-connector adapters for
  agents, tools, model providers, and memory. Filesystem-based
  enumeration only — no live tool-registry queries (deferred to a
  follow-up). Provider entries never leak raw API keys (only env-var
  names + base URLs).
- **A5** Removed dead `AgentRestarter` and `HookEventHandler`
  interfaces. Both had zero implementations across the four built-in
  connectors. Reintroduce as `S2.6`/`S2.7` if a real call site
  surfaces.

### Test Parity (Phase E)

OpenClaw's test footprint — 14+30 Go tests, 31+ Python files, a full
`scripts/test-e2e-full-stack.sh` Phase 7 — was significantly ahead of
ZeptoClaw, ClaudeCode, and Codex. This rollup brings the other three
to parity at the integration / acceptance / e2e tiers without adding
any production-code coupling between the four.

- **E1** Go integration parity: per-connector subtests added across
  `sidecar_test.go`, `proxy_test.go`, `gateway_test.go`,
  `connector_cmd_test.go`, `device_test.go`, `watcher/rescan_test.go`.
  Notable additions: `TestProxy_PerConnectorPrefixStrip`,
  `TestSwitchConnector_PerConnectorPersistsState`,
  `TestApplyRuntime_PerConnectorSwitch`,
  `TestHandleGuardrailEvent_OTelAgentName_PerConnector`,
  `TestConnectorVerify_CleanPerConnector`.
- **E2** Python CLI parity: new `test_zeptoclaw_config.py`,
  `test_claudecode_config.py`, `test_codex_config.py` exercise
  per-connector config shape, MCP enumeration, skill/plugin path
  resolution, and patch/restore round-trips. New
  `test_cmd_guardrail_matrix.py` parametrizes
  `guardrail status/enable/disable` over all four connectors with
  mocked `_restart_services`.
- **E3** Acceptance / `test/e2e/` parity: new
  `connector_lifecycle_matrix_test.go`,
  `v7_observability_connector_matrix_test.go`. Existing
  `TestConnectorVerifyCleanOnFreshDataDir` now covers all four
  connectors via `*PathOverride` seams. New
  `test/e2e/connectormatrix.go` provides the canonical
  `connectorMatrix(t)` fixture helper.
- **E3.4** S3.4 carry-overs: per-connector golden directories under
  `test/e2e/testdata/v7/golden/{openclaw,zeptoclaw,claudecode,codex}/`,
  new `goldenPathForConnector` helper, layout-locking
  `TestGoldenPerConnectorLayout` test. `assertThreeTierIdentity`
  doc comment block now enumerates all four connectors.
- **E4** Live shell e2e + GH Actions matrix:
  `scripts/test-e2e-full-stack.sh` gains `phase_connector_artifact_matrix`
  (Phase 2C) that asserts per-connector hook-script presence on disk.
  `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` gains a `connector-matrix` job with a
  `[openclaw, zeptoclaw, claudecode, codex]` matrix axis (fail-fast:
  false) that runs the four connector lifecycle / verify / OTel parity
  test packages on `ubuntu-latest`. The `e2e-required` gate enforces
  all four cells.
- **E5** Shared fixtures: new Go `internal/gateway/connector/connectortest/`
  test-only subpackage with `WithTempHome`, `SeedZeptoClawConfig`,
  `SeedClaudeCodeSettings`, `SeedCodexConfig`, `SeedSkillDir`,
  `SeedPluginDir`. New Python `cli/tests/connector_fixtures.py`
  with `make_zeptoclaw_config`, `make_claudecode_settings`,
  `make_codex_config`, `with_connector` context manager. Shared
  fixture data under `test/fixtures/connectors/<name>/`.

### Documentation

- New `docs/CONNECTOR-MATRIX.md` — canonical statement of by-design
  connector limitations (ZeptoClaw `before_tool`, Codex hook
  invocation), what the matrix supports today, and the proxy-side
  enforcement model.
- New `test/e2e/testdata/v7/golden/README.md` — explains the
  per-connector golden subdirectory layout and how it interacts with
  the connector-agnostic baseline.
- `docs/CONNECTOR-REMAINING-FIXES.md` — items resolved by this rollup
  (file locking, atomic writes, dead interface removal,
  HandleHookEvent stub) marked DONE; the remaining items continue to
  track what's deferred.

### Verification (Phase D)

The rollup is gated by a four-step verification suite:

1. `go test ./... -race -count=1` — must pass (locked-in test updates
   from Phase B already reflected in the codebase).
2. `cd cli && python -m pytest -x -q` — must pass (1419 + new tests).
3. `cd extensions/defenseclaw && npm test` — must pass (TypeScript
   plugin telemetry + correlation context).
4. **D4** S8.1/S8.2/S8.3 verification:
   - **S8.1** Codex env scoping: `~/.codex/config.toml`
     `[providers.openai].base_url` is patched; no global
     `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is exported to user shell rc.
   - **S8.2** Setup writes only the picked agent: a
     `setup guardrail --agent codex` run leaves `~/.claude/settings.json`
     byte-identical.
   - **S8.3** Observe mode: a known-block prompt under
     `cfg.Guardrail.Mode = "observe"` exits the hook with `0` and
     records a `would_have_blocked` audit entry.

   If any of the three regress, Phase F supplies a pre-staged fallback
   for re-implementation.

### Explicitly out of scope

- **ed25519 plugin manifest signing** (S0.1) — deferred.
- **ZeptoClaw `before_tool` hook wiring** — architecturally not
  feasible (host-side limitation); documented as WONTFIX in C3.
- **Codex external-script hook invocation** — host-side limitation;
  the `[hooks]` block we write is forward-compat, never invoked
  by today's `codex` binary.
- **Hook-handler body relocation into `internal/gateway/connector/`**
  (C1 second commit) — the registration seam landed; the 1.4 KLoC
  body move is staged for the follow-up to keep this rollup
  reviewable. No production-code coupling depends on the move.
- **Live tool-registry enumeration in AIBOM** — querying a running
  gateway / MCP servers for their dynamic tool listings requires a
  connected gateway, deferred.
- **Migration of `Config.ClaudeCode` / `Config.Codex` typed fields to
  a polymorphic `connectors.<name>.<settings>` keyspace** — separate
  refactor PR after this rollup lands.
- **`UninstallPlan.revert_<connector>` per-flag expansion** (E2/item 4
  literal wording) — superseded by the connector-aware
  `_connector_teardown(plan)` path that already dispatches via
  `--connector $name`. Per-connector teardown coverage lives in
  `cli/tests/test_install_smoke.py::test_smoke_matrix`.
