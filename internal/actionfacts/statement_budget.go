// ShellStatementsOverBudget reports whether a POSIX shell command has more
// statements than one action evaluates (maxStatementsAlone, 128), counted
// as SimpleCommands splits it: list members, pipeline stages and the
// commands of bodies. SimpleCommands reports such a command as a "limit"
// failure while the analysis keeps its text; a command whose analysis
// stopped earlier, at the node or input bound, is over the same budget, so
// the limit is the same at every size up to the hook payload cap (GAP-0146,
// GAP-0568). A command that does not parse is not counted here.
