## Tech Stack (locked)

- **Go 1.25+** — single binary, cross-compile to linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64
- **Cobra + Viper** — CLI framework + config
- **Bubbletea + Lipgloss + Bubbles** — TUI (charmbracelet stack)
- **SQLite** (`modernc.org/sqlite`) — audit log, scan results, block/allow lists (no external DB)
- **YAML** — config at `~/.defenseclaw/config.yaml`, OpenShell policies
- **goreleaser** — cross-platform builds + homebrew tap

## Key Files

- `cmd/defenseclaw/main.go` — entrypoint
- `defenseclaw-spec.md` — product spec (source of truth, read-only)
- `internal/scanner/scanner.go` — Scanner interface all scanners implement
- `internal/scanner/result.go` — ScanResult + Finding types (unified output)
- `internal/audit/store.go` — SQLite schema and operations
- `internal/enforce/policy.go` — Admission gate (block -> allow -> scan)
- `internal/config/claw.go` — Claw mode resolver (skill dirs, MCP dirs per framework)
- `internal/tui/app.go` — TUI root model
- `internal/tui/command.go` — `BuildRegistry()` TUI→CLI command map (single source of truth for what the TUI can invoke)
- `internal/tui/cli_parity_test.go` + `scripts/audit_parity.py` — parity gate that prevents TUI/CLI drift
- `internal/tui/doctor_cache.go` + `cli/defenseclaw/commands/cmd_doctor.py::_write_doctor_cache` — cached doctor snapshot for the Overview panel
- `docs/TUI.md` — panels, keybindings, parity model, files the TUI touches

## Unified LLM Configuration (v5)

DefenseClaw resolves every LLM setting — guardrail, judge, MCP scanner,
skill scanner, plugin scanner — through a single top-level `llm:` block
with per-component overrides. NEVER read `cfg.InspectLLM`,
`cfg.DefaultLLMModel`, `cfg.DefaultLLMAPIKeyEnv`, or `cfg.Guardrail.Model`
directly; they are legacy shims retained for pre-v5 config
back-compat. The only correct accessors are:

- Go:     `cfg.ResolveLLM("guardrail" | "guardrail.judge" | "scanners.mcp" | "scanners.skill" | "scanners.plugin" | "")`
- Python: `cfg.resolve_llm(<same paths>)`

Both return an `LLMConfig` whose every non-empty override field wins over
the top-level block. Empty fields inherit from the top level, then from
`DEFENSECLAW_LLM_MODEL` / `DEFENSECLAW_LLM_KEY` env vars, then (last
resort) from the legacy `default_llm_*` fields. The
`defenseclaw setup migrate-llm` subcommand is the operator-facing path to
collapse a v4 YAML onto the v5 shape; it backs up `config.yaml` first.

For LiteLLM-backed scanners, centralize provider→env mapping via
`cli/defenseclaw/scanner/_llm_env.py::inject_llm_env`; never shell-out
raw `OPENAI_API_KEY=…` from the scanner wrapper.

## Claw Mode

DefenseClaw supports multiple agent frameworks via `claw.mode` in config.
Currently: `openclaw`. Future: `nemoclaw`, `opencode`, `Codex`.

All skill/MCP directory resolution derives from the active mode
(`internal/config/claw.go`). OpenClaw skill resolution order:

1. `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` — workspace/project skills
2. Custom `skills_dir` from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — user-configured path
3. `~/.openclaw/skills/` — global user skills

## Conventions

- `internal/` for all packages — nothing exported outside the binary
- Errors: `fmt.Errorf("package: context: %w", err)` — prefix with package name
- Context: every public function takes `ctx context.Context` as first arg
- No global state — pass deps via struct constructors
- Table-driven tests — `t.Run` subtests, one `TestXxx` per exported function
- CLI commands return `error` — Cobra handles exit codes, never call `os.Exit`
- Scanner wrappers shell out to Python CLIs — never rewrite them in Go
- OpenShell orchestrated, not replaced — write its policy YAML, don't fork it

## Admission Gate

```
Block list? -> YES -> reject, log, alert
             NO -> Allow list? -> YES -> skip scan, install, log
                                NO -> Scan
                                      CLEAN -> install, log
                                      HIGH/CRITICAL -> reject, log, alert
                                      MEDIUM/LOW -> install with warning, log, alert
```

All six paths must be tested.

## Build Iterations

1. ~~Skeleton + Scan + AIBOM~~ — repo structure, init, scan commands, SQLite audit ✓
2. ~~Block/Allow + Enforcement~~ — block/allow lists, quarantine, OpenShell policy sync ✓
3. ~~TUI~~ — four-panel bubbletea dashboard (Alerts, Skills, MCP Servers + status bar) ✓
4. ~~Deploy + CodeGuard + Full Flow~~ — orchestrated deploy, CodeGuard, status/stop ✓
5. Docs + Plugins + OSS Polish — plugin system, installer, goreleaser, CI

## Gotchas

- Python scanners (`skill-scanner`, `mcp-scanner`, `aibom`) are external deps — pip install, don't vendor
- `modernc.org/sqlite` is pure Go (no CGo) — required for easy cross-compilation
- Block must take effect in under 2 seconds, no restart — event-driven enforcement, not polling
- Allow-listed items skip scan gate but are still logged and inventoried
- TUI refreshes within 5 seconds — subscribe to audit store changes
- macOS has no OpenShell — degrade gracefully: scan + lists + audit work, sandbox enforcement skipped
- Two webhook surfaces exist and are NOT interchangeable:
  - `webhooks[]` (notifier): per-event chat/incident fan-out (Slack/PagerDuty/Webex/HMAC). Managed by `defenseclaw setup webhook` + TUI wizard; dispatched by `internal/gateway/webhook.go::WebhookDispatcher`.
  - `audit_sinks[].http_jsonl` (log forwarder): every-event JSONL POST. Managed by `defenseclaw setup observability add webhook`.
  `cooldown_seconds` on `WebhookConfig` is `*int` (tri-state): nil → `webhookDefaultCooldown` (300s), `0` → disabled, `>0` → explicit. Python `WebhookConfig.cooldown_seconds` is `int | None` and round-trips the same three states.
- TUI mutations route through the Python CLI — never reimplement an action in Go. The mapping table is `internal/tui/command.go::BuildRegistry()` and it's gated by `internal/tui/cli_parity_test.go`, which uses `scripts/audit_parity.py` to introspect the live Click tree. If you add a TUI action you must add the matching Click subcommand first; the parity test will fail loudly otherwise.
- `defenseclaw doctor` writes `~/.defenseclaw/doctor_cache.json` on every run (success or failure). The Go TUI's Overview panel reads it on startup + after each doctor invocation. Stale threshold is 15 min — see `internal/tui/doctor_cache.go`. Don't bypass this cache by running doctor's network probes from Go.

## v7 Observability Gotchas

- **Provenance** is stamped by `gatewaylog.Writer.Emit` (via `Event.StampProvenance` at the writer choke point) — do not stamp provenance manually at arbitrary call sites.
- **`LogActivity`** bypasses the sanitizer for `activity_events` payload columns (`before_json` / `after_json` / `diff_json`) but **not** for the redacted summary row in `audit_events` / sink fan-out.
- **Sink failures** emit a metric, a gateway structured event, and an audit row — when adding new failure modes, wire all three surfaces consistently.
- **Three-tier identity:** never collapse `agent_instance_id` onto `sidecar_instance_id`; they are different dimensions (session/process vs gateway process).
- **`make check-v7`** must pass before any PR that touches audit actions, gateway error codes, or JSON schemas (`check-audit-actions`, `check-error-codes`, `check-schemas`).
- **Golden events** under `test/e2e/testdata/v7/golden/` are part of the downstream contract — regenerate only with `go test ./test/e2e/ -run TestGoldenEvents -update` and review the diff.

## Boundaries

- `defenseclaw-spec.md` — read-only, do not modify
- Splunk SIEM adapter available (HEC-based, batch + real-time). No approval queues or IAM integration in v1
- Never store secrets in code or config — use OS keychain or env vars
- No `os.Exit()` outside `main()` — return errors up the stack
- Never rewrite Python scanners in Go — wrap them
- Never replace OpenShell — orchestrate it
- Never require root — everything runs in userspace
- Single binary — no Docker dependency for DefenseClaw itself
