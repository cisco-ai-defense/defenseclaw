# #1210: run the enterprise package's real prerm and postrm under dpkg and
# Debian's /bin/sh (dash) in a disposable container, and check that a
# removal stops the sandbox user units in a signed-in account's user
# manager, as that account, after the system units, and removes the
# socket's global enable link; and that an upgrade leaves them alone.
# systemctl is a stub that records its calls (a container runs no systemd);
# runuser, getent, stat and dpkg are the distribution's own.
#
#   docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src:ro" debian:bookworm sh /src/packaging/linux/tests/deb_container_check.sh
#
# A removal whose user manager does not answer fails and keeps the package,
# and the next removal goes on once it answers.
#
# On a host without docker (for example a build host), unpack a Debian rootfs into a
# scratch folder and run it there as root in a private mount and pid
# namespace, with DC_CONTAINER_CHECK=1:
#   sudo unshare --mount --pid --fork --propagation private sh -c \
#     "mount --rbind /dev ROOT/dev && mount -t proc proc ROOT/proc && \
#      mount -t tmpfs tmpfs ROOT/run && mount -t tmpfs tmpfs ROOT/tmp && \
